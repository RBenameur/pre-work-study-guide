          <li>The body element: represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Semantic elements: indicate role of their content and give structure to webpage. Where possible use semantic elements as it makes the HTML easier to read for developers and users using accessibility software.</li>
          <li>The main element: is where the main body of the website sits.</li>
          <li>The h1 element: should only be used once - it defines the title of the webpage.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>inline CSS: written into the opening tag of an element, for one-off permanent styling but not very flexible.</li>
          <li>internal style sheet: embedded stylesheet into the head section of a webpage using 'style' element. can configure ID and class attributes but limited to only one webpage.</li>
          <li>external style sheet: linked in the head element. Best practise as most lean on code - one CSS file can style multiple webpages. link using 'link' element.</li>
          <li>margin: adds space outside element.</li>
          <li>padding: adds space inside element.</li>
          <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) code: use commas for applying styling to multiple selectors at once.</li>
