# Prework study guide

## Description

My motivation was to summarise the key take home points regarding setting up a website using HTML, CSS and Javascript, that users learning to code can use to refresh on best practises. Information can be spread across many different webpages and websites so I wanted to provide comprehensive and compact information all on one page.

I learned:
* To stucture information semantically using HTML
* To style information using CSS inline, internally and externally
* To add interactivity to a website using javascript by creating and using functions
